            Hi, I'm Naoki. I have just started a career in software engineering.
            I was born in Japan and grew up in a city called Fukuoka. This city
            is the origin of tonkotsu ramen and also famous for a lot of unique
            foods. There are a lot of good places to eat and visit. If you ever
            come to Fukuoka, I will reccomend you the best places to go.
            <br /><br />As a career,

              I studied bioinformatics in this masters degree. My research was
              focused on analysing SARS-CoV-2 by using bioinformatics methods.
              <br /><br />In this reseach, we were looking into the differences
              of strains in the genetic sequences. After revealing the
              differences in the sequences, we investigated the effect in the
              protein structures which directly changes the feature of the
              virus. <br /><br />
              This was also my first time coming to the UK. There are a lot of
              differences between the UK and my home country. Although having
              many difficulties, it is a great opportunity to live in a country
              which is quite different.
